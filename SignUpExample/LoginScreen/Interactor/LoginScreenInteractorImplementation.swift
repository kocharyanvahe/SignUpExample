//  Currently, the usage of this class is unusefull because it's repeating the same logic which is exist on LoginService.
//  But this implementation ready for exteding in case of there should need to use multiple services.
//  This class will encapsulate the realization of their interface from Presenter and allow us easily change the interface of services.
